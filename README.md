# Dice-Metropolis

This is a game which is heavily inspired by [Machi Koro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machi_Koro).

It will incorporate all logic needed for the Machi Koro base game, the harbor axpansion, millionaire's row and the dice tower promo card. It will even be expandable beyond that. Many functions are currently work in progress.

In an attempt to reduce the chances of anybody considering this a copyright infringement I have not included any cards. You can add your own though. The API for this is explained in the wiki and doc folder. I might release my own set of cards somewhen that also more balanced that the original Machi Koro cards.
